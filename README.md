- So, my programming journey started in grade 9. Curious about the competition, which competes against other students to be the gifted, I signed up for it. 
- Well.. I thought the subject was about Microsoft Office because the name was concidentally similar to computer scienece. Guess what? I'm suprised to find myself hooked on programming.
- Currently learning c++ with other 2 languages, but with less attention.
>*Idk what to do with this so I decided to write an introduction, I guess?*
*I will eventually polish my README.md after fully exploring the features of GitHub.*
